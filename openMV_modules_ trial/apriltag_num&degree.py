# AprilTags Example
#
# This example shows the power of the OpenMV Cam to detect April Tags
# on the OpenMV Cam M7. The M4 versions cannot detect April Tags.

import sensor, image, time, math

sensor.reset()
sensor.set_pixformat(sensor.RGB565)
sensor.set_framesize(sensor.QQVGA) # we run out of memory if the resolution is much bigger...
sensor.skip_frames(time = 2000)
sensor.set_auto_gain(False)  # must turn this off to prevent image washout...
sensor.set_auto_whitebal(False)  # must turn this off to prevent image washout...
clock = time.clock()

# Note! Unlike find_qrcodes the find_apriltags method does not need lens correction on the image to work.

# The apriltag code supports up to 6 tag families which can be processed at the same time.
# Returned tag objects will have their tag family and id within the tag family.

# What's the difference between tag families? Well, for example, the TAG16H5 family is effectively
# a 4x4 square tag. So, this means it can be seen at a longer distance than a TAG36H11 tag which
# is a 6x6 square tag. However, the lower H value (H5 versus H11) means that the false positve
# rate for the 4x4 tag is much, much, much, higher than the 6x6 tag. So, unless you have a
# reason to use the other tags families just use TAG36H11 which is the default family.
